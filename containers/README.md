# Create containers to be deployed in pods

Convert necessary YAML files to use ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES as values instead of static values.

Allows for ease of configs in pods and future configuration. 

## Automate the small stuff:

Create scripts to get and alter master. 

Generate /etc/environment files for each container. 
{Generate one massive /etc/environment file for all?}

Scripts to get default values from master branch. 

Create master pod config[s]
